# DINAMITE Compiler Docker

To install, run `./get_tarballs.sh` first to gather all the LLVM and Clang source archives.

You will need Docker installed on your system, and the daemon running. Run `docker build .` in the current directory to build the container image. Script `run_container.sh` contains an example invocation line for this container. Feel free to use that, or come up with you own.
